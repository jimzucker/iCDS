<img width="200" height="200" align="left" src="https://github.com/jimzucker/iCDS/blob/master/images/512_iCDS_Icon.jpg">

The 1.0 version of the application will implement a SNAC(Standard North American CDS), upfront fee calculator using the ISDA Standard CDS Model, www.cdsmodel.com and based on the functionality found on the MarkIt partners website, www.markit.com/cds. The applications free. Its only objective is for the author to have a non-trivial application in the iPhone AppStore. The approach of the application is to recalculate the upfront fee and intermediate results and display them as the user changes outputs using the quick entry controls or the pickers accessed by pressing the buttons displaying the inputs.

I started this project when as a 'former' Mac developer I was swept up by the excitement of the iPhone App phenomenon. This led me to a drive to get a non-trivial application into the App Store. I convinced my family to buy me a MacBookPro for my birthday in Sept, 2009 and about 20 hours of effort latter I had my first GUI prototype running on the simulator.

Along the way I have learned a lot about the rich environment of information sharing now happening in the development community. I was re-introduced to the Apple Development Tools (XCode) and the Snow Leopard OS. Not having touched MPW(Macintosh Programmers Workshop) in over 15 years, it was like I never left home with the added power of the underlying LINUX environment that I am well versed in using every day at work. I then was introduced to new resources including ITunes U, blogs and code.google.com.
